# QueryAr

> Best pronounced like a pirate: QueryARRR!

Gives you a DSL to build filtered, scoped, paged and sorted ActiveRecord queries, based on a parameters hash

### Really quick usage example

Given this ActiveRecord model:

```ruby
class User
  scope :older_than, ->(years) { where("age > ?", years) }
end
```

You can declare a query:

```ruby
class UserQuery
  include QueryAr

  defaults sort_by: 'last_name'

  queryable_by :first_name, :last_name
  scopable_by  :older_than
  includable   :images
end
```

Then use it to query your model safely and succinctly from controller params:

```ruby

# GET /users
# params = { "include"=>"images", "older_than"=>30, "first_name"=>"Stu", "limit"=>5, "offset"=>0 }

def index
  users = UserQuery.new(params).all
  render json: users
end
```

### I've seen enough, how do I install it?

I'm going to release to rubygems shortly, once I'm certain the interface won't change too much. Right now you
can add to your Gemfile and reference github.

### Need more info? A real-world example

We have a Place (ActiveRecord) model with attributes and scopes to filter on, so we have all of the power of the AR query DSL at our fingertips.

```ruby

class Place < ActiveRecord::Base

  scope :in_group, ->(place_grouping) { ... }

  scope :nearby_place_id, ->(place_id) { ... }

end
```

We want to provide a REST API with, amongst other things, an index action for querying lists of places.

The [Hooroo Places](http://places.hooroo.com) API accepts this request for GET-ing the first 10 "See & Do" places near Mamasita with "Museum" in the name, ordered by name. 
It also allows requests to specify (according to the pattern set out in the [JSON API spec](http://jsonapi.org/) what related objects to serialise, too:

```
"/api/places?include=images,comments.author&in_group=see_do&nearby_place_id=mamasita&name=museum&sort_by=name&limit=10&offset=0"
```

When our Rails app receives this request it parses the query string as a params hash, like this:

```
{"include"=>"images,comments.author", "in_group"=>"see_do", "nearby_place_id"=>"mamasita", "name"=>"museum", "sort_by"=>"name", "limit"=>10, "offset"=>0}
```

QueryAr provides a standard, declarative way to get from the above params hash, to a queried ActiveRecord relation like this:

```ruby
Place.includes(:images, comments: [:author]).
  .in_group('see_do')
  .nearby_place_id('mamasita')
  .where(name: 'museum')
  .order('name')
  .limit(10)
  .offset(0)
```

### Define a query

Continuing our example, the object responsible for taking a set of params and constructing a scoped and eager-loaded AR relation is the Query. 
Here's what the PlaceQuery would look like:

```ruby
class PlaceQuery
  include QueryAr

  defaults sort_by: 'name', sort_dir: 'ASC',
    limit: 10, offset: 0

  queryable_by :name, :street_address
  scopable_by  :in_group, :nearby_place_id
  includable   :images, comments: [:author]
end
```

The above class deals with building queries for the Place model, and declares that:

* there will be specific default sorting and pagination for Places
* only Place attributes ```#name``` and ```#street_address``` can be queried on
* the Place scopes that can be applied are ```#in_group``` and ```#nearby_place_id```
* ```place.images```, ```place.comments``` and ```place.comments.author``` are the only place relations that *can* be included in the JSON response

In our Places Controller, we use this class like so:

```ruby
def index
  places = PlaceQuery.new(params).all
  render json: places
end
```

You can also find single records. Includes will still be taken into consideration:

```ruby
def index
  place = PlaceQuery.new(params).find
  render json: place
end
```

The find method will look for a param called ```id``` by default, but you can pass another key in if your params are named differently:

```ruby
def index
  place = PlaceQuery.new(params).find(:place_id)
  render json: place
end
```

The public interface of every query object is as follows:

```ruby
query.all
#=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [Place(id: 157 name: Melbourne Museum)...]>

query.find
#=> Place

query.count
#=> 10 # number of records #all contains

query.total
#=> 13 # total (unpaginated) result count

query.summary
#=> {
#     offset: 0, limit: 10,
#     sort_by: 'name', sort_dir: 'ASC',
#     count: 10, total: 13
#   }
```

The summary is designed to be placed into the JSON response as a meta key, although the details of serialising the response into JSON is intentionally left out of this gem.

### Run-down of DSL:

#### defaults

Keys and values specifying defaults for things like ```sort_by```, ```sort_dir```, ```limit``` and ```offset```.

#### queryable_by

Declares what attributes can be queried in the ActiveRecord ```where``` clause.

#### scopable_by

Declares which scopes on your model can be queried on.


#### includable

Declares what related items on your model's graph can be included in the response. Allowing the client to specify what size of payload they require.

## TODO:

* Make global defaults configurable in code (initialiser/yaml)
