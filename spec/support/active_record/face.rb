# To avoid having ActiveRecord as a development dependency of
# this gem (whose sole purpose is to chain AR queries - YOLO),
# we use this class in tests. Usage is as follows.

# Declare a class that inherits us instead of AR::Base
#
#   class User < ActiveRecord::Face
#     scope :active
#   end

# Chain a bunch of query methods together
#
#   > User.active.where(name: 'stu').order('name').limit(10).offset(0)

# Find out what messages where received and with what args, useful for assertions
#
#   > User.messages_received
#   => {:active=>[], :where=>[{:name=>"stu"}], :order=>["name"], :limit=>[10], :offset=>[0]}
